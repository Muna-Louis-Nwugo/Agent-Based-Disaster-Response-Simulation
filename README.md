# ðŸ’£ Disaster Response Simulation
#### An agent-based simulation designed to model resource management, first-responder decision making, and civilian behaviour during a catastrophic urban event.

For the past couple of months, I've been swimming in the shallow pools of simulation with my Wildfire Project, and that project gave me the confidence to try swimming in a small lake. I recently learned about Agent-based modeling, and it gave me the idea to turn back time a bit. This project was inspired by the 9/11 attacks on New York City. While I had originally intended to test different Emergency Response systems and compare aspects such as communication and unified vs un-unified control, I quickly realized that all of that might be just a little outside my capabilities at the moment. So I scaled it back to a system that models how first responders are dispatched and make decisions while also discovering interesting emergent behaviours that could occur when you have hundreds or thousands of civilians fleeing a single catastrophe. A sort of general educational resource for anyone interested, though I would love to come back and build that original idea once my skills permit it.
