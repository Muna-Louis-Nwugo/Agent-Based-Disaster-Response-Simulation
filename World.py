World Module - Main simulation engine for the Urban Catastrophe Simulation.

This module contains the World class which manages the spatial environment, agent population, 
and simulation state. It handles:
- Grid-based city representation with roads, buildings, and intersections
- Agent spawning, movement, and collision detection
- Simulation tick updates and event dispatching
- Spatial queries for pathfinding and agent perception
- Communication between agents and environment

The World class serves as the central coordinator, maintaining the 100x100 cell grid
and orchestrating all agent behaviors during catastrophic events.
