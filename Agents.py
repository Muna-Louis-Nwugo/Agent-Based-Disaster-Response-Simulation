Agents Module - Autonomous entities for the Urban Catastrophe Simulation.

This module contains agent classes that populate and navigate the urban environment.
It handles:
- Agent state management (health, patterns, goals)
- Movement and pathfinding execution
- Perception and decision-making logic
- State transitions during catastrophic events
- Inter-agent awareness and collision avoidance

Agent types include Civilians, Paramedics, and Firefighters, each with distinct
behaviors and priorities during emergency scenarios.
